# Strapi App as Jusos Heidelberg backend

This is a simple test run of the backend component for a possible new Jusos Heidelberg website. 
## Overview

The Strapi app serves as headless content management system. It is currently deployed and run in production mode on Heroku at
https://jusos-content.herokuapp.com

The content is stored in a PostgresQL database also hosted by Heroku, and can be edited after logging in to
https://jusos-content.herokuapp.com/admin
(ask @mwalcher3 for credentials)

The content structure (content types, new fields, etc.) is coded in the app. It can only be altered with the app running locally in development mode by a user with super admin priviledges.

To be visible to editors, alterations to the content structure or other changes to the app should be committed to gitHub from where they are being continuously deployed to Heroku.
