# Strapi App as Jusos Heidelberg backend

This is a simple test run of the backend component for a possible new Jusos Heidelberg website. 
## Overview

The Strapi app is the headless CMS currently deployed in production mode on Heroku at
https://jusos-content.herokuapp.com

Content is stored in a PostgresQL database also hosted by Heroku, and can be edited after logging in to
https://jusos-content.herokuapp.com/admin
(ask @mwalcher3)

Changes to the content structure (content types, fields etc.) 
Commits to GitHub are continuously deployed to Heroku.

The PostgresQL database is also provided by Heroku.





Commits to GitHub are auttomatically deployed to Heroku. The content structure can be altered in development mode. To be in development mode, the strapi app has to run locally and the user has to be a super admin.
